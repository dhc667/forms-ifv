- element renderers should receive well-typed values
- on value change for element renderers should be id specific, they shouldn't have the full api
- my forms page table should be componentized
- search bar should sort stuff faster, or add a debounce
- form not found style bad contrast
- tables should fill their container, ensure horizontal scroll if necessary
